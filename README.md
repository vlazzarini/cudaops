Experimental CUDA Streaming Phase Vocoder Opcodes
=======================

This repo contains a number of experimental opcodes for Csound using CUDA. They implement parallel processing versions of existing Csound opcodes.  The majority of these opcodes were originally developed by Andrea Crespi under the supervision of Victor Lazzarini at Maynooth University. A number of test routines are also provided,
which were used to generate the experimental data for Crespi's [Master's thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/122542/1/Andrea%20Crespi%20-%20Master%27s%20Thesis.pdf).
